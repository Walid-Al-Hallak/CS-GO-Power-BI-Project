# CS-GO-Power-BI-Project
This repository serves as a tool to showcase a personal data analytics project in which I analyze data from 100 minutes worth of CS:GO matches from 2017 to find insights.

I used this opportunity to familiarize myself with different Power BI features, including DAX, Slicers, Visualizations, and many more, which allowed me to build a dynamic and engaging 2-page report. The first page covers the game state, and the second page covers the rounds state.

Out of the many insights I found is the dominant use of the AK-47, the tendency to plant on B rather than on A, the round-type distribution, as well as many others that can be unraveled when you dive into the report.
